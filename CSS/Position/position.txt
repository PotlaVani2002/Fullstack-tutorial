There are 5 positions available in CSS.
They are:

  iv.  sticky
  v. relative

i. static: static Position will not have any impact on top, bottom,left,right. By default all elements will have Position "static"
ii. relative: relative Position is used to move an element top,bottom,left or right from its current position
iii. absolute: absolute position is used to move an element based on the body
iv. fixed: fixed is used to move an element based on body but scrolling will not any impact on it
v. sticky: sticky is initially relative but later changes to fixed until the parent exists
