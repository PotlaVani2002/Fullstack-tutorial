Lists are used to list out items. We use daily grocery list, members list, todo list,memu list,contacts list ,etc..
Some lists needs order and some don't.
HTML divides lists into 3 categories
    1. Ordered list:It is used to represent lists which needs an order
    2. Unordered list:it is used to represent lists which doesn't need any order.
    3. Definition lists:it is used to represent lists which needs to be explained

1.Ordered Lists:
    --Ordered lists uses 'ol' tag and each list item will be 'li' tag 
    --ol tag has attributes
        -type: A,a,i,I,1(default)
        -start: always takes number only -- we can use start attribute to define where to start our list.

2.Unordered Lists:
    --unordered Lists uses 'ul' tag and each list item will be 'li' tag
    --ul tag attributes
        -type: square,circle,none,disc
    --default type is bullet points.

3.Definition Lists/Description:
    --definition lists uses 'dl' tag for list and each list item will be 'dt'- definition term tag and 'dd' -  definition data tag .
        'dd' - definition data tag -will give some space on left side.
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML/dt>
        <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Cascading Styles Sheet</dd>
        <dt>JS</dt>
        <dd>Javascript</dd>
    </dl>
We can also keep one list inside another list called nested lists.
