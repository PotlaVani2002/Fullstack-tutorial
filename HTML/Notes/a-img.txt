Anchor tag: Anchor tag is used to connect another page/resource. It is done by 'a' tag and it uses attributes like 
        href---contains link/path to connect 
             path means -local
             link means -cloud
        target--- We use _blank value to open in new tab
ex: <a href="path to file" >Click to openfile </a>
<a href="path to file" download >Click to download the file </a>

images:We can insert images in html using 'img' tag.
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior.
img tag contains attributes
        src-- contains link/path of the images
        alt--  contains alternative title which works in the absence of src
We can even set height and width of the images using 'height' and 'width' properties
An element without a closing tag is known as a void element.
